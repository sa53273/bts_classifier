# BTS Member Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Objective: 
Developed a deep learning model to classify images of BTS members using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Technologies Used: 
TensorFlow, Keras, Python, OpenCV, matplotlib

## Outcome:

Built, trained, and evaluated CNN from scratch.
CNN architecture fro https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/.
Successfully deployed a robust image classifier capable of distinguishing between seven BTS members with 89% accuracy.
