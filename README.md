# BTS Member Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify images of BTS members based on their distinctive visual features. By leveraging deep learning techniques, a robust model has been developed capable of accurately identifying each BTS member from photos.

### Project Background

The project was inspired by the need to automate the process of identifying BTS members in diverse contexts, such as fan photos, social media posts, and event coverage. The classifier employs state-of-the-art techniques in image recognition, enabling it to distinguish between different members with high accuracy.

### Implementation Details

The classifier is built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras framework. The principles outlined in the Keras example for image classification from scratch (https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/) were followed to develop and fine-tune the model. This ensures that the classifier not only performs well but also adheres to best practices in deep learning model development.

### Key Features

- **CNN Architecture**: The model architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, batch normalization for stabilizing learning, and dense layers for classification.
  
- **Training and Evaluation**: The model was trained on a dataset comprising images of BTS members, validating its performance using a separate test set to ensure generalization.
