# BTS Member Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks


Developed a deep learning model to classify images of BTS members using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Built, trained, and evaluated the CNN from scratch. CNN can distinguish images of the seven BTS members with 89% accuracy.

Created using TensorFlow, Keras, Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. CNN architecture from https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_from_scratch/.


Outcome: Proves once and for all that the members of BTS do not all look alike.
